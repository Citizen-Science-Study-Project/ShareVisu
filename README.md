# Project description

For the study project "Building a Social Citizen Science Network Communication and Collaboration Tools for the openSenseMap" our group focuses on reimplementing interpolation in order to add more useful heatmap-like visualization layers for each of the measured phenomena to the existing OpenSenseMap. In addition to that we aim to extend the feature for storing and sharing visualizations in the OpenSenseMap, so that users are able to share both static maps aswell as dynamic visualizations with other users. This can be done via a simple link and/or images, videos or GIFs.
